# Hangman Game
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Hangman game repository! This repository contains a classic implementation of the Hangman game using a text-based user interface. The game randomly selects a word from a list of 3000+ 5-letter words and allows players to guess the word letter by letter.

## Game Rules
* ðŸ”¤ The game follows the traditional Hangman rules:
* You have a maximum of 6 incorrect guesses before you lose the game.

* The game only accepts single-letter guesses.
